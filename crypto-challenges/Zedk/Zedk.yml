  Welcome, Innovator .
  You've been selected to take part in an elite SecBoot RSA Challenge, a mission where your wits and cryptographic skills are your only weapons. Your task is to decrypt the secret messages hidden within encrypted payloads. Each message represents a key component a digital "song" that will unlock the sequence to reveal the ultimate secret.
  As you progress, you'll be handed pieces of secure information that will be used to simulate a real-world RSA decryption scenario. One wrong move resets your mission, so precision is paramount. The fate of this digital frontier lies in your hands. Prepare yourself for a test of logic, persistence, and mastery of cryptographic puzzles.
  Your mission begins now. Step forward, decode the messages, and prove your expertise. Embrace the challenge and unlock the secrets of the digital realm.
difficulty: "mid"
