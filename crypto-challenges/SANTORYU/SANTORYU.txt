SANTORYU :
The Blade Sequence 
🗡 First Blade
 Zoro starts with a silent strike. It doesn’t leave a mark on the outside—but deep within, it changes everything.
 Each letter is touched, one by one, using a repeating pattern only he knows.
 This technique scrambles the message based on a secret phrase. Without the exact same phrase, it’s impossible to reverse.
🗡 Second Blade
 Now that the message is scrambled, Zoro wraps it in a disguise.
 He takes the corrupted version and translates it into something readable, using a popular system.
 It’s often used in emails and web data something that turns messy symbols into neat ones.
Hint: It’s a common way to turn binary or raw bytes into a clean string.
🗡 Third Blade
 The final strike is a twist. Literally.
 Every letter is rotated, swapped for another in the alphabet a fixed number of steps away.
 If you know the pattern, reversing it is easy. In fact, it’s an old-school cipher often used in jokes and simple puzzles.
Hint: It's a Caesar-style shift. 

⚠️ Important Hint:
 Each paragraph is more than a story it holds the secret to a transformation.
 Zoro’s sword style may sound familiar : the key to this challenge is quite as it is .
