description: "Challenge: The Triple Lock

“They say there’s a secret vault hidden deep within the datastream—its door sealed by not one, not two, but three layers of encryption. Legends whisper that only the boldest cryptanalysts, those who dare peel back each veil, will glimpse the treasure within.”
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to breach the Triple Lock and claim what lies beyond. One false move, and the vault seals itself tighter.
