# SecBootCamp CTF Challenges

Welcome to the SecBootCamp CTF repository! Inside you’ll find three tracks of challenges:

- **Cryptography**  
- **OSINT**  
- **Miscs**  

Each challenge lives in its own folder and comes with:

- A `README.md` describing the goal, hints & link (if any)
- A `<challenge_name>.yml` for metadata (author, description, difficulty, points)
- A `flag.txt` when you’ve solved it
