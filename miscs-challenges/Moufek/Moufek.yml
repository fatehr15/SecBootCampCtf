description: "Under the vaulted arches of the Cryptography Hall, Professor Moufek a master of linear algebra and cipher‐breaking placed a single, unmarked file before his students .
“With this,” he said, “you’ll build your own decryption function.”
No hints of the underlying method were given , only their knowledge of matrices, modular arithmetic, and basis transformations .
As afternoon light faded, the classroom buzzed with discoveries : echoes of lecture-hall equations, subtle modular patterns, and the thrill of reconstructing the hidden “CIC{…}” flag.
At last, each student held their crafted function , ready to unlock the secret concealed in that lone file, guided only by the structure they unearthed themselves.
